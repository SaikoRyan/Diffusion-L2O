## Overview
We introduce Diff-L2O, a novel learning-to-
optimize (L2O) optimizer that utilizes diffusion
models to directly generate high-quality solutions
of general yet diverse optimization problems.
While prior studies in L2O focus on generating
predictions for variable updates, Diff-L2O
takes a different approach by iteratively refining
solutions through denoising techniques.
